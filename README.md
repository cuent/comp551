# COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains the solutions and exercises done in the course COMP 551 at McGill University in Winter 2019.

## Assignment 1
Use linear regression to predict the popularity of comments on Reddit. The solutions can be found in [assignment 1 folder](assignments/assignment1). See the [instructions](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject1_spec.pdf).

## Assigment 2
Develop models to predict the sentiment of IMBD reviews. The solutions can be found in [assignment 2 folder](assignments/assignment2). See the [instructions](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject2_spec.pdf). Achieved a F1-score of 0.92880 in test, see the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp-551-imbd-sentiment-classification/leaderboard).

## Assignment 3
Use CNNs to classify a modified version of MNIST. The solutions can be found in [assignment 3 folder](assignments/assignment3). See the [instructions](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject3_spec.pdf). Achieved a 0.99 accuracy, see the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp-551-w2019-project-3-modified-mnist/leaderboard)).

## Assigment 4
Reimplement a research paper. We participated in track 1 making an analysis of state-of-the-art of VAEs. [assignment 4 folder](assignments/assignment3). See the [instructions](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject4_spec.pdf).
